# Community Structure Identification - Semester 232

This is the repository for anything related to the subject of Math4CS.

In this note, I will use the initial of CSI for **Community Structure Identification**.

## Understanding the problem of CSI
CSI is a problem of identifying groups of related nodes (called **communities**) in a graph.

## Overview of existing

~~Graph can be stored in a **adjacency list** to be used with the [Hierarchical Clustering](https://www.mmds.org/) (see *Mining Massive Dataset for more details) or the [Girven - Newman algorithm](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.122653799). In brief, communities are assigned based on the weight of vertices of one node to their neighbor. Using an adjacency list would help the algorithm easily get the vertices of an inspecting node when comparing with the **adjacency matrix** representation.~~
